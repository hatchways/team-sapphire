- **Sorting Functionality:** Mentions can be sorted either by most recent, most popular and most positive.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Mentions have either a blue, grey or red face emoticon to indicate the general tone of the post. Hovering over the face emoticon indicates the comparative score of the post. The score ranges from -1 to +1. The more positive the number the more positive the post. The more negative the number the more negative the post.
